- 👋 Hi, I’m @everbass
- 👀 I’m interested in tips, tutorials on Python and programming logic. I want to become a Python expert.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning Python, from scratch, combined with algorithms and programming logic. I have dedicated at least 2 hours a day just to learn the language. I am finding the possibilities of this language more and more incredible.

- 💞️I hope to collaborate soon with those who also want to start a new journey. I'm 43 years old, I have advanced knowledge of excel and this programming universe inspires me and makes me feel alive. ...
- 📫 How to reach me...
Well, I abandoned social media to focus on learning Python and other more important things in life. But I have email (pavaobass@gmail.com) and this account.
